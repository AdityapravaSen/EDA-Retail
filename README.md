## Observations from Project-

From the Observations we conclude that FURNITURE CATEGORY is the WEAK AREA where we need to work upon. As in Furniture we have TABLES and BOOKCASES where due to HIGH DISCOUNT offered we are incurring LOSSES. So we need to REDUCE the DISCOUNT in order to INCREASE the PROFIT.
